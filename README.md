# Sampling a Near Neighbor in High Dimensions

This repository contains the source code and infrastructure code to reproduce the experiments in the paper `Sampling a Near Neighbor in High Dimensions --- Who is the Fairest of Them All?`.

## Reproduce experiments

Install required python packages by running `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`. Adapt the python paths in `run_exp.sh` (highly recommended to use pypy in the second part), run `run_exp.sh` and then `run_running_time_exp.sh`.

We provide a docker container with all requirements installed. It can be carried out by running the commands like so: `dockerrun bash run_exp.sh`.

The experiments will take around 1 day on a standard desktop machine. All experimental results will be stored in `exp-res`, and the plots can be generated by executing the Jupyter notebook `eval.ipynb`.
